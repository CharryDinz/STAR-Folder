#### Situation: 
Today is my first day of internship, and my training begins with learning how to use the program through VS Code to automatically apply for job positions on LinkedIn accounts.

#### Tasks:
- I will learn and familiarize myself with the process of running the program by following the steps.

- I will read about the [Active Listening: Techniques, Benefits](verywellmind.com)

#### Actions:
- I need to update and [Install the Windows 11](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ways-to-install-windows-11-e0edbbfb-cfc5-4011-868b-2ce77ac7c70e) on my laptop as a requirement to gain access to the program. I will also need to check for any hardware compatibility issues before proceeding with the installation.


#### Results:
I will continue to advance my knowledge on running the program through VS Code to LinkedIn accounts, and will also consult helpful resources and links for additional information.
