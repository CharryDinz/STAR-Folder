## STAR 
---
#### SPACE: 
I join the meeting session with the coach to collaborate and share some GitHub-related thoughts.

#### TRACK:
I have been creating markdown files that document my daily progress and achievements using the STAR (Space,Track,Assist and Reach).I have been saving these files in my own repository folder, which allows me to easily access and review my progress over time.This allows me to clearly communicate my accomplishments and the value during my internships.

 At the same time I'm watching the tutorial video from SharePoint about the **Web Design and Content Creation**
 
#### ASSIST:
I'll keep learning by watching the SharePoint and NoteHive video  in order to comprehend things better.

#### REACH:
Today, I do organize my GitHub Files to seperate the images, STAR and Note folder. I am excited to continue learning and improving my skills, through this internship program.
