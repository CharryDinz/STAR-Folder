2. Type and click the **Remote Desktop Connection.**
3. Put the address that provided to get access on the remote computer.
4. Click the **VS Code Software**
5. To start running the program, navigate to the bottom of the screen, press the **up arrow** key on your keyboard twice, and then press the **enter** key.

**Take Note:** Allow the bot to run and search for a specific position on LinkedIn. Making sure that it does not apply to more than 300 jobs in one day. So that,this will prevent the system from detecting that we are using a bot.

6. After that, go to the bottom of the screen, to press the **up arrow** key on your keyboard twice, and then press the **enter** key.
7. Then, **minimize the chrome** so it will not mess up, to run it all day.
8.  By closing the program just click **(Ctrl+C)**


#### ASSIST:
I need to update and [Install the Windows 11](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ways-to-install-windows-11-e0edbbfb-cfc5-4011-868b-2ce77ac7c70e) on my laptop as a requirement to gain access to the program. I will also need to check for any hardware compatibility issues before proceeding with the installation.

Also, I will read about the [Active Listening: Techniques, Benefits](verywellmind.com) to improve my listening skills.


#### REACH:
I will continue to advance my knowledge on running the program through VS Code to LinkedIn accounts, and will also consult helpful resources and links for additional information.
