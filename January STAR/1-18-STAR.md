#### SPACE: 
Today is my second day of my internship. I joined a meeting with the senior to discuss and follow up on what I learned during the VS Code to LinkedIn training on how to run the program. Additionally, I am continuing to shadow experienced  to gain a deeper understanding of how to effectively conduct discovery calls for new onboarding applicants. This has been a valuable learning experience as I have been able to observe the call flow.


#### TRACK:
We reviewed the key takeaways from the VS Code to LinkedIn training and discussed ways to improve our process for running the program. The senior provided valuable feedback and suggestions for optimizing the program's performance.

Additionally, I am continuing to study the free materials. Like getting some badges in [Atlassian University](https://university.atlassian.com/student/catalog) and for [Jira](https://charry-tasks.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CT/boards/1) sotfware.


#### ASSIST:
The first step in running the program for VSS Code to LinkedIn is to ensure that  have the necessary software and dependencies installed on the computer. This includes VSS Code and the LinkedIn.
