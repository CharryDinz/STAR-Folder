## STAR 
---
#### SPACE: 
As part of my internship, I have been creating markdown files that document my daily progress and achievements using the STAR (Space,Track,Assist and Reach). I also have meetings with the coach to discuss and clarify any questions or concerns that I have. 

#### TRACK:
I have been saving these files in my own repository folder, which allows me to easily access and review my progress over time.This allows me to clearly communicate my accomplishments and the value during my internships.

 At the same time I'm watching the tutorial video from SharePoint about the **Copywriter Workflow with DevOps**
 

#### ASSIST:
I am still continuing to watch tutorial videos on SharePoint to gain a deeper understanding of how to effectively use the platform. I am finding the videos to be very informative. 

#### REACH:
This experience provided me with valuable insights and I am excited to continue observing and learning from the team during my internship.Overall, I am enjoying my internship and I am looking forward to continuing to learn and grow throughout the program.
