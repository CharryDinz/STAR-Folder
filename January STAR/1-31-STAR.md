### STAR
---
#### SPACE:
I will join the call with the mentor and focus on the tasks assigned on GitHub. 

#### TRACK:
I am dedicating my time to navigate and look up all the repository if they have folders that shows all the photos of the property. That allow me to learn and contribute to the project. 

#### ASSIST:
I will continue to study the manual training that discuss with my mentor,while working on the assigned tasks for the property repository on GitHub.

#### REACH: 
I've been immersing myself in learning through various free materials as well as to complete the tasks for GitHub. I had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of the training manual that shared to our mentor.
